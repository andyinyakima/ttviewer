Addendum: 2July2016

Made some modifications- removed w_scan because it wouldn't create the correct zap files.
Installed "scan" in its place. VLC has been replaced with mpv it is much more manageable.
Am using UDP instead of RTP to for the communication protocol. 

This will be added to bitbucket using git instead of mercurial.

07 March 2019 

Added multicast addressing .i.e address box defaults to 127.0.0.1 but can be edited to 239.1.1.234 or 
similar multicast address 

Added two "scan" files, yakima_ATSC.txt has the frequencies for Yakima un-commented so that
they will be picked up during a scan. USA_ATSC.txt is fully commented, just un-comment the
# marks for your area frequencies and those stations will be scanned in.

# Clang Code Model was a nuisance after Qt Creator 4.11.0 Qt 5.12.8
#Go into Help->About Plugins and uncheck the Clang code model plugin.
#You have to restart qt creator after that to make it take effect.
#I had the same problem when debugging a unit test. I was debugging code
#not in the project itself and it was dying repeatedly on me sending tons of kernel messages.
